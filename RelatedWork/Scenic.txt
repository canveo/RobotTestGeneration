This paper is about a domain-speicifc scenario description language scenic. They use this language to generate images of good, bad and general images. Where generate is 1-4 cars each facing 0-10 degrees of the road direction. The good and bad days consisted of good or bad road conditions (day/night) (clear/rainy). They show that squeezeDet a CNN real time object detector for autonmous cars performs worse on the bad set as compared to the good or general (which is expected).
They then ask the question "in synthetic data setting we are limited not by data availability but by the cost of training". They show that they can over-represent the hard cases, without loosing accuracy on the easy case. They show that they can increase the networks performance on hard cases by over-representing the hard cases in the data.
Basically they show that they can measure where networks do badly and then increase the number of images of that type of scenario into the training.

Large amount of work on generating artificial data sets for speicic applications
Closely related work: domain adaption, which attempts to correct differences between synthetic and real world input distributions
Scenes have been generated using constraints and procedural generation from shape grammars
