This paper is about testing autonmous robot control algorithms. They generate scenarios and score them. Situations which show dangerous behaviour are flagged.
In this paper they want to use procedural content generation to generate a wide range of diverse situations that have a high likelyhood of finding dangerous behaviour.
They score each of the log files and allow humans to then select the log files with the highest score
