# Unity

This is the code used to visualize the FlightGoggles simulator. The visualization was redesigned using Unity to include only free assets. To rebuild the simulator you need to download the unity hub. Import this folder as a project and you should be able to recompile the simulator for testing.

The main content is included in Assets:

* **Prefabs**: Contains the blocks used as walls, weather conditions and orbs used to represent waypoints.
* **Drone**: Contains the drone object which is simulated
* **Scripts**: Contains the code used to connect to ROS and updated the simulation.
